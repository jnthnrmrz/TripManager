# TripManager
The trip manager helps keep the plans of a trip in a nice organized format. 
The user will be able to choose the time of the trip and how long it will take along with a name and a budget. 
The user can then click on each weekâ€™s day and view a particular day. It will be able to get the events from google places and drag it to the trip board. 
Once on the board the user can assign a date and any more info.

## How to Use:
To view a demonstration of this web app please notify me by email at getjonathanramirez@gmail.com and I will get back to you asap. 
Since the code requires the database created it will not work properly without it. 
However, there are test cases that can be run to test individual parts of the code.
